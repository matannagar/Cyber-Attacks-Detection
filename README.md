# Methods for Detecting Cyber Attacks

The course is based on understanding the building blocks of learning systems and their implementation in the areas of defense
Cyber. The purpose of the course is to improve the students' research skill and allow them to experiment
In defined research during the course and free and in-depth research on a variety of topics within a project
The summary.<br>
The course highlights the difficulty and challenges that exist in the areas of cyber defense, performing in a wide wall on
Possible threats and solutions through the use of learning systems.<br>
The cyber world is a magical and challenging world and the aim of the course is to make exposure to this world in the process
Strengthening students' personal research abilities. <br>
The course will perform a damage detection tournament and the implementation of academic articles as a summary project.
